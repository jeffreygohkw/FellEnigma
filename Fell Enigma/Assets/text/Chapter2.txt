You: Listen up. We have a commission from the royal army to take out a neighbouring country’s contingent at our borders. I know you may have your grudges with the kingdom but the job pays well and they are our countrymen.
Distress Signal: To any of our allies who can hear this, please send help immediately. We are being overwhelmed by the enemy at Fort Desaix! At this rate, I don’t think we can….. <signals cut>
Young Rebel: Sounds serious. I suppose we head there to save our poor fellow countrymen?
Naive Prince: They should be able to manage themselves. If we take down the enemy leader first, their ranks will fall. 
Kind Soul: I agree with you, Naive Prince. That will be the most efficient method. Fort Desaix is known to be a fortress with heavy defenses. It won’t topple in a day or two.
Black Heart: And there will be casualties. I don’t really care about them since they sold their lives to the kingdom as soldiers but I believe lives should be not so easily disregarded like that.
Kind Soul: That is true but but...
Young Rebel: Old Man! Take the lead, we won’t be going anywhere if we continue wasting time here.
Naive Prince: Hey, don’t be rude. It’s sir. S.i.r.

Narrator: Since all your main units can no longer battle, this battle is deemed lost. And they are gone forever….
