Narrator: The night after…..
Black Heart: I need a break.
Kind Soul: Well, we have travelled the whole day. How about we rest here? 
Naive Prince: Before that, we need to do an equipment check,scout the surroundings, arrange guard shifts…. Oh but first we need to report back to sire….. *mumbling*
Young Rebel: Now now, everyone’s tired. We are in a village, aren’t we? Prince, how about we get some lodgings for the girls there and do a night visit while we are at it?
Kind Soul: Oh we are visiting the village? Can I come along?
Young Rebel: Hahahaha Miss, it’s not a visit in the night, it’s that kind of night visit.
Kind Soul: Oh….I knew that. How crude.
Young Rebel: Shall we get goin- It seems we have unwanted guests paying a night visit too.
Black Heart: A dozen or so.
Young Rebel: Hmm, looks like tonight’s a bright moon and a bloody night. Come on Prince, they ain’t waiting for you.
Naive Prince: Huh? I am still halfway with reporting….. Wait what????
Bandit Leader B: Alright boys. That rumored lady boss should just be around here. I want her alive. A dead body ain’t good for selling and torturing after what she did to our guys.
Kind Soul: It seems like they are here for her. If we leave now, we won’t involve the village.
Young Rebel: Heh, if only that’s the case. The bandits will probably ravage the village if we don’t kill them right here right now.
Naive Prince: Argh, finally I got through. Sire, what are our orders?
Narrator: Doors are present in this map. They are normally closed, blocking off your path but if you have a key, you can unlock it. This will be considered an action.

Narrator: Since all your main units can no longer battle, this battle is deemed lost. And they are gone forever….
